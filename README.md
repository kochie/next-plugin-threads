# threads.js plugin for next

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Currently the new next plugins system is unstable and likely to change so this plugin will probably not work.

Use threads.js directly with next.

Create a new project
```
npx create-next-app <app-name>
```

Then just add threads
```
npm i -D next-plugin-threads threads
```

And bam! threads in js.
